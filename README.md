# HPTU Result Finder

This project is a web application that allows B.Tech students of Himachal Pradesh Technical University (HPTU) to easily access and filter their results. The application scrapes data from [HPTU Results](https://himachal-pradesh.indiaresults.com/himtu/default.aspx) and displays it in a user-friendly interface. Users can filter results by semester, branch, and scheme to find relevant information quickly.

> **Note**: The website only supports B.Tech students. Results for other trades are not available.
